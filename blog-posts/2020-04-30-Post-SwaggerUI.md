Swagger UI is the interface to visualize and interact with a serviceâ€™s REST APIs. The appearance of the Swagger UI generated from the Swagger contract is provided by [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/). You can update the UI to add company branding for continuity across your Micro Focus Swagger interfaces.

### Swagger UI
This project is a Micro Focus branded version of the Swagger UI. It is available as a WebJar or an NPM package and can be easily integrated in Spring Boot, Dropwizard, or Tomcat applications and services. Using the included hooks to override Swagger configuration parameters, you can further customize the appearance of the Swagger UI. You can also easily implement updates to both the Swagger and Micro Focus styling.
