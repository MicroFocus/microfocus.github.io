Swagger UI is the interface to visualize and interact with the application's REST APIs. The appearence of the Swagger UI that is generated from the swagger contract is provided by [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/). Micro Focus projects would benefit from having the company specific branding and uniform appearence of their Swagger interfaces.
